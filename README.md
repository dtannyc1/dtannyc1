### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David, welcome to my GitHub page:

I'm currently working at [Soopra.ai](https://www.soopra.ai/) as a Full-Stack Software Engineer after graduating App Academy's coding bootcamp in June 2023. My technical skills include React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rails, and Flask. If you have an app idea that you need help implementing, let's grab some coffee and talk about it! Take a look at my [portfolio](https://dtannyc1.github.io/dtannyc1/) if you want to see some of my recent work and projects.
