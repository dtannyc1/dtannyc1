### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David, welcome to my GitHub page:

In March 2023, I decided to join App Academy's coding bootcamp to pivot towards software engineering and to start building modern web applications that can be seen worldwide. If you have an app idea that you need help implementing, let's grab some coffee and talk about it! Take a look at my [portfolio](https://dtannyc1.github.io/dtannyc1/) if you want to see some of my projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Davescord](https://github.com/dtannyc1/Davescord), a clone of Discord
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on your pet project. The goofier, the better.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Mechanical Engineering! While I don't work in the field anymore, I still love everything I learned about it
- ðŸŽ¸ Fun Fact: I play guitar and sing in my down time. Music truly is the best therapy
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me at dtannyc1@gmail.com
