### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David, welcome to my GitHub page:

In June 2023, I completed App Academy's coding bootcamp to pivot towards software engineering and to start building modern web applications that can be seen worldwide. Since then, I've been interning, freelancing, and building my skills in full stack web development using React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rails, and Python. If you have an app idea that you need help implementing, let's grab some coffee and talk about it! Take a look at my [portfolio](https://dtannyc1.github.io/dtannyc1/) if you want to see some of my recent work and projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently interning at [Soopra.ai](https://www.soopra.ai/), a startup which allows experts, educators, and influencers to create authentic AI personas trained to behave in their likeness. I built the voice interface based on Figma designs and worked on the retrieval-augmented generation process.
- ðŸš— I'm building a Twitch-integrated racing game - see it live [here](https://www.twitch.tv/andythefrenchy) at the start of every stream. Make sure to engage in Twitch chat for your chance to find the boost word and win yourself a first place prize!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on your pet project. The goofier, the better.
